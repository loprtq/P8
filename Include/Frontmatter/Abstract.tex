This project is a study of option pricing using numerical methods, such as neural networks and finite difference. Data for the project is obtained from Polygon.io (\url{https://Polygon.io}), with the data obtained being the maturity time, strike price, stock price, and option price.

The project starts with preliminary theory regarding the numerical methods required for the application, particularly neural networks and finite difference.

Application of the theory begins with determining the best architecture for a neural network for the implied volatility function. It then moves on to training the neural network for the implied volatility surface, and using it to determine the risk-neutral density, which is then used to compute option prices. Additionally, multiple neural networks for the option pricing function were constructed, leading to improved results over the other method.

The discussion is primarily focused on improvements for future use, as well as the presumable issues and inconsistencies that arouse during the application.
